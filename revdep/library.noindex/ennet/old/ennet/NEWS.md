# ennet 0.2.0

Second [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) release of `ennet` package.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed NOTE on CRAN checks for non-ASCII characters (192 marked UTF-8 strings)

* Removed `DiagrammeR` as a dependency package and removed the code chunk in 
respective vignette that creates the ennet workflow. The workflow diagram is
now done using an external drawing tool (OmniGraffle) instead of within R using
`DiagrammeR`. This prevents issues on CRAN when vignettes are produced.

### Enhancements/Improvements

* refactored the `count_topics` and `count_authors` functions into new more
coherent functions for counting topics and other related metrics (previous
functions have now been deprecated);

* added new functions to retrieve data from the [en-net database](https://github.com/katilingban/ennet_db);

* added new functions to process and handle data from the [en-net database](https://github.com/katilingban/ennet_db); and,

* updated documentation to reflect the enhancements/improvements implemented.
