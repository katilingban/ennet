[en-net](https://www.en-net.org) is the go to online forum for field practitioners requiring prompt technical advice for operational challenges for which answers are not readily accessible in current guidelines. The questions and the corresponding answers raised within en-net can provide insight into what the key topics of discussion are within the nutrition sector. This package provides utility functions for the extraction, processing and analysis of text data from the online forum.

## Installation

`ennet` is in active development and is not yet available from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org).

<!---
You can install the released version of rennet from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```r
install.packages("rennet")
```
--->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
if(!require(remotes) install.packages("remotes"))
remotes::install_github("katilingban/ennet")
```

## Usage

`ennet` package provides a set of functions that extracts information from the [**en-net** online forum](https://www.en-net.org). This set of functions was built on top of the [`rvest`](https://rvest.tidyverse.org) package which provides robust and performant web scraping functions and the [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) package which provides a full suite of data manipulation functions. The `ennet` package was designed to be able to interact with how the **en-net** online forum has been structured.

### en-net website structure

The **en-net** online forum website has a very clear and clean structure. The opening page is a list of **thematic areas** which are linked to each of their respective webpages. In each of these **thematic area** webpages is another list, this time a list of **topics** raised within the **thematic area**. These **topics** are the text that an online user provides as the title for the question she/he is going to ask. Each of the **topics** are then again linked to their respective webpages that show the actual full question raised and the ensuing responses and **discussion** stemming from that question.

### Getting list of thematic areas

To get a list of thematic areas along with the link to the webpage of each thematic area, we use the `get_themes()` function as follows:

```{r usage1, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(ennet)
get_themes()
```

This will be useful when choosing which themes to focus on when extracting information. This function outputs an object of the appropriate class and structure as the required input for the `get_themes_topics()` function which would lend to piped operations between the two functions (see below).

### Getting list of topics from thematic area/s

To get a list of topics for a particular theme, we use the `get_theme_topics()` function as follows:

```{r usage2, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
## Load dplyr to facilitate data manipulation
library(dplyr)

## Extract data from "Coverage assessment" theme
get_themes() %>%
  filter(themes == "Coverage assessment") %>%
  select(links) %>%
  as.character() %>%
  get_theme_topics()
```

To get a list of topics for multiple themes, we use the `get_themes_topics()` function as follows:

```{r usage3, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
## Extract data from "Coverage assessment" theme and "Food assistance" theme
get_themes() %>%
  filter(themes %in% c("Coverage assessment", "Food assistance")) %>%
  get_themes_topics()
```

### Getting discussions from topic/s

To get a list of discussions for a particular topic, we use the `get_topic_discussions()` function as follows:

```{r usage4, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
get_themes() %>%
  filter(themes == "Coverage assessment") %>%
  get_themes_topics() %>%
  filter(Topic == "Resources for coverage assessment") %>%
  select(Link) %>%
  as.character() %>%
  get_topic_discussions()
```

To get a list of discussions for a set of topics, we use the `get_topics_discussions()` function as follows:

```{r usage5, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
get_themes() %>%
  filter(themes %in% c("Coverage assessment", "Food assistance")) %>%
  get_themes_topics() %>%
  get_topics_discussions()
```
