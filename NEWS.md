# ennet 0.2.1

This is the third CRAN release of `ennet`. This is a patch release to fix a
test that uses an input that used to throw an error but now does not. This
test has now been fixed.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed test for `create_db_topics_monthly` that used an input for a date of
2021-02-01 which earlier would provide an error but now that it is already
February, this input doesn't throw an error. This was changed to
2020-01-01 instead.

# ennet 0.2.0

Second [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) release of `ennet` package.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed NOTE on CRAN checks for non-ASCII characters (192 marked UTF-8 strings)

* Removed `DiagrammeR` as a dependency package and removed the code chunk in 
respective vignette that creates the ennet workflow. The workflow diagram is
now done using an external drawing tool (OmniGraffle) instead of within R using
`DiagrammeR`. This prevents issues on CRAN when vignettes are produced.

### Enhancements/Improvements

* refactored the `count_topics` and `count_authors` functions into new more
coherent functions for counting topics and other related metrics (previous
functions have now been deprecated);

* added new functions to retrieve data from the [en-net database](https://github.com/katilingban/ennet_db);

* added new functions to process and handle data from the [en-net database](https://github.com/katilingban/ennet_db); and,

* updated documentation to reflect the enhancements/improvements implemented.

# ennet 0.1.0

First release of `ennet` package.

The `ennet` package has two key sets of functions:

to produce summary measures and statistics of the 
[**en-net** online forum](https://www.en-net.org).
