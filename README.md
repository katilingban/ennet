[en-net](https://www.en-net.org) is the go to online forum for field
practitioners requiring prompt technical advice for operational
challenges for which answers are not readily accessible in current
guidelines. The questions and the corresponding answers raised within
en-net can provide insight into what the key topics of discussion are
within the nutrition sector. This package provides utility functions for
the extraction, processing and analysis of text data from the online
forum.
