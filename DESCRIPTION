Description: en-net is the go to online forum for field practitioners
    requiring prompt technical advice for operational challenges for which
    answers are not readily accessible in current guidelines. The questions
    and the corresponding answers raised within en-net can provide insight into
    what the key topics of discussion are within the nutrition sector. This
    package provides utility functions for the extraction, processing and
    analysis of text data from the online forum.
