Description: The Emergency Nutrition Network or en-net forum is the go to online 
    forum for field practitioners requiring prompt technical advice for 
    operational challenges for which answers are not readily accessible in 
    current guidelines. The questions and the corresponding answers raised 
    within en-net can provide insight into what the key topics of discussion are 
    within the nutrition sector. This package provides utility functions for the 
    extraction, processing and analysis of text data from the online forum.
